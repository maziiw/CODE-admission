After days or trialling, I was unable to produce a mockup computer vision model. Unfortunately, my skill level does not match what is required. I would love to learn all this at Code. Below, I listed out some of the literature I used to produce the mockup, and also challenges I encountered. The list is quite long and I realised I will not be able to complete this task.

Please do consider my other work - building the web, coding the webapp and creating a workflow process.

All the above are documented in my GitHub page.


Challenges I encountered:
- working with virtual environments / or as the tutorial suggests - Anaconda venv
- pros and cons of using Docker / Poetry
- debugging
- Visual Studio showing errors which Terminal solves
- nvidia CUDA toolkit not supported for iOS


Literature: [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
